Hi, I’m @TheJellyFishGuy and I make my programs using the latest version of Python. There's still many things i have to learn, but I can say that I'm pleased with the results of my code.
I’m looking to collaborate on anything anyone suggests, while It's made in Python 3.11
You can reach me on Discord as thejellyfishguy, but my name will be Oddit in most cases.
